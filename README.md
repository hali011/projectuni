# ProjectUni - Python Calculator

This is a simple calculator project developed using Python with a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. The project is divided into two main parts: core functions and GUI. 

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Graphical user interface similar to the Windows calculator.
- Unit tests for both core functions and the GUI.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following files:
- `calculator_functions.py`: Contains the core functions for arithmetic operations.
- `calculator_gui.py`: Contains the GUI code for the calculator.
- `test_calculator_functions.py`: Unit tests for the core functions.
- `test_calculator_gui.py`: Unit tests for the GUI.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/hali011/projectuni.git
    cd projectuni
    ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

## Usage

Run the calculator by executing the `calculator_gui.py` file:
```sh
python calculator_gui.py
